It also has lesser syntactical constructions like in other languages.

2) What are the distinct features of Python?
Answer: The distinct features of Python include the following.

Structured and functional programmings are supported.
It can be compiled to byte-code for creating larger applications.
Develops high-level dynamic data types.
Supports checking of dynamic data types.
Applies automated garbage collection.
It could be used effectively along with Java, COBRA, C, C++, ActiveX, and COM

3) What is Pythonpath?
Answer: A Pythonpath tells the Python interpreter to locate the module files that can be imported into the program. It includes the Python source library directory and source code directory.

4) Can we preset Pythonpath?
